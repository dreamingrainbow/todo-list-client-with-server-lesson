# todo-list-client-with-server-lesson
In this lesson we refactor our previous todo-list-redux-client app and add Redux promise and Axios. We also add our first server side application using express.

First we can create our server. We can create the `todo-list-server` folder to build our server application in, and we can clone our `todo-list-client-redux-lesson` as we will modify it slightly to add Axios, and redux-promise middleware.

Once we create the new folder, and have cloned the other repository we can create our server and tie the two together.
Below are the links to the instruction on how to create the server and client.
